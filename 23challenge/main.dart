/*
Write a procedure(sub) drawstars that will draw a sequence of
spaces followed by a sequence of stars. It should accept two parametersâ€”the number of spaces and the number of stars.
E.g
Drawstars(3,5) would produce
_ _ _ * * * * * ( _ indicates a space!)
Use your procedure to draw
         *
       * * *
       * * *
         *

   * * * * * * *
